## 📡 Abstract
**Protocol 1728** is an open-source framework designed to reverse-engineer human potential. Unlike subjective self-help methods, this protocol utilizes a fractal architecture (**12** Areas $\times$ **12** Sub-areas $\times$ **12** Key Questions) to generate a standardized score of **0–100** based strictly on **Hard Data** (biometrics, financial logs, telemetry).

The objective is to provide an interoperable data foundation for human optimization for the next 100–1000 years.

## 📐 Core Architecture (The Logic)

The system operates under a **Lexicographical Order of Importance**. The user must not sacrifice a higher-tier area to optimize a lower-tier one. This prevents "fragile optimization."

### The 12 Domains (Hierarchy v1.0)
1.  **Health (Bio-Performance):** The biological engine. Without ATP/Sleep, cognitive execution is impossible.
2.  **Resilience & Risk (OPSEC):** Safety and continuity. Preventing "Game Over" scenarios.
3.  **Finance (Resources):** Runway and viability.
4.  **Direction (Problem Selection):** Choosing the right game before playing it well.
5.  **Knowledge (Epistemology):** Navigation and correct premises.
6.  **Capacity Management:** Matching load with energy.
7.  **Data & Metrics (Telemetry):** The "Go/No-Go" decision systems.
8.  **Psychosocial:** Network, feedback loops, and mental hygiene.
9.  **Productivity (Throughput):** Transforming direction into deliverables.
10. **Distribution:** Value delivery and feedback latency.
11. **Creativity (R&D):** Exploration of new value vectors.
12. **Moat & Reputation:** Compounding long-term advantages.

### 🛡️ The "60-Point Trap" Mechanism
The protocol implements a logic gate: If a **Meta-Pareto KQ** (Critical Key Question) scores $< 60$, the entire Domain is capped at **60**.
* *Implication:* You cannot compensate for sleep deprivation (Health < 60) with a high bank balance. The system forces bottleneck resolution.

## 📂 Open Core Modules
We are currently releasing specific modules for **Peer Review**.
