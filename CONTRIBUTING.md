# Contributing to Protocol 1728

Thank you for your interest in the Human Operating System.
This is a high-precision engineering project, not a general discussion forum.

## 🛡️ Guiding Principles
1. **Zero Conjecture:** We do not accept subjective opinions ("I feel this is better"). We accept mathematical proofs and hard data.
2. **Lexicographical Integrity:** Changes cannot violate the core hierarchy (e.g., sacrificing Health for Productivity).
3. **The 60-Point Rule:** Any proposed metric must have a clear logic trap for critical failures.

## 📝 How to Submit
* **Bug Reports:** If you find a logical fallacy in the math.
* **Feature Requests:** If you have a fully formed rubric for a new Sub-area.
* **Pull Requests:** Must follow the `[AREA] - Description` format.

*By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the project's CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.*
